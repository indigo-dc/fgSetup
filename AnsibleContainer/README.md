# Containers for the Container king

You like Ansible ! You like Containers ! You **LOVE** [Ansible Container](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible-container). You've tried the shell scripts. They were fun for a while, but you need something... a little... more... _exciting_. So you try yourself some Ansible. Now, we're getting somwhere, you think to yourself. Feels good to scratch that itch, doesn't it !? Yeah baby, right there...

But it's not enough for you. You need this done _right_, dammit. So, you think - what's next ? Then it comes to you :

**Just add containers !**

# How to use this stuff

You need AnsibleContainer. Go get it, I'll wait...
